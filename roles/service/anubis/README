# Simple Anubis installer

This role installs and deploys Anubis on CentOS/RHEL. The installation is done on the host where the httpd
service is running.

Anubis is installed with its default policies; the role allows the definition of a white list of
IP ranges + a "magic header" that bypasses verification.

Anubis expects the following httpd config:

httpd:443 --ProxyPass--> Anubis:{{ anubis_bind_port }} ---> {{ anubis_target }}

Typically "anubis_target" will point at an extra virtualhost defined in httpd's config.
