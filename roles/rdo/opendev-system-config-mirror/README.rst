Configure an opendev mirror

This role installs and configures a mirror node

**Role Variables**

This role has been copied over from the OpenDev system-config role available
at https://opendev.org/opendev/system-config/src/branch/master/playbooks/roles/mirror,
so it can be modified to be compatible with the CentOS infrastructure we use.
