# worker MPM
# MaxConnectionsPerChild: maximum number of requests a server process serves
#
# We've noticed that our mirrors occasionally have stale workers. This leads
# to ssl certs not being refreshed properly after reload and we've also seen
# ssl connections to round robin backend services have trouble. Restarting
# the workers so that they load up new info seems to fix this. Try and force
# that to happen regularly with a connections limit per worker.
