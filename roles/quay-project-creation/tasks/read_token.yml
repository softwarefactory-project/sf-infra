# NOTE: The application token is connected to the userspace.
# In other words, 'admin' user can not create organization for
# another user without its token. In that case, we read the
# token for the user, which got admin privileges and then
# we operate on that.
# To generate that token, login as a user via web client
# create organization "config", then create new application that
# have all privileges.
