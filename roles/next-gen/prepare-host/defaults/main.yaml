  # NOTE: on the old host we were using openstacksdk==1.4.0, but the Ansible version was
  # 2.15.3. On current host, the Ansible version is 2.14.2, which is incompatible
  # with openstacksdk, so it raises an error:
  # "msg": "Incompatible openstacksdk library found:
  # Version MUST be >=0.36 and <=0.98.999, but 1.4.0 is larger than maximum version 0.98.999."}
  # Let's set the version what it expect.
  - openstacksdk<= 0.98.999
