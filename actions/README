# One shot actions

Create or update a playbook to execute one shot actions such as
server reboot or known_hosts cleanup.

For example, to perform an one time action on the bridge:

* Create a playbook like so

```console
$ cat << EOF > do-x-bridge.yaml
- hosts: bridge.softwarefactory-project.io
  tasks:
    - name: Remove incorrect known host
      command: sed -i 42d .ssh/known_host
EOF
```

* Submit or push the change

```console
$ git add actions/do-x-bridge.yaml; git commit -m "bridge: remove incorrect known host"
$ git review   # (git push support could be implemented too)
```

* Look at zuul status page and check the console output
