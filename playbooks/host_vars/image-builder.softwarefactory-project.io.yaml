# Cloud names is a variable that defines in which OpenStack cloud should
# the next-gen pruner be running. That var also ensures that the image-builder
# ssh key is available in OpenStack resources: openstack keypair show image-builder.
# It is because we want to use cleaner script for many clouds on same host.
cloud_names:
  # NOTE: crc_images will be used to create scripts + crontab jobs.
  # The rule is: common vars that are repeating in most crc_images
  # can be set globaly, but you can overwrite it by setting
  # same parameter in crc_images. For example:
  # NOTE:
  # The nodepool-tripleo cloud will have nested and extracted version
