# This is the bootstrap playbook, run it once to create the bridge
# NOTE(jpena): when rebuilding the bridge, make sure to also modify
#              the playbooks/tasks/create-hosts.yaml playbook, so
#              the role that generates /etc/hosts.yaml is executed.
#              Otherwise, we will have issues later when running
#              the sf-infra-configure-hosts role
